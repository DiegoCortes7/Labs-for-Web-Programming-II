# Lab 24 – Extra Credit: HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

## Status: Incomplete / Attempted

This lab was my attempt to simulate setting up HTTPS in a Node.js Express application using Let's Encrypt.

### What I Tried:
- Created a basic Express server and added HTTPS module.
- Tried to use `.pem` files for local certificate simulation.
- Followed the steps as far as I could with my current setup.

### Issues Faced:
- I was unable to get OpenSSL working on my machine.
- Because of that, I couldn’t generate proper `.pem` files.
- I encountered errors when trying to run the server with placeholder files.

### Final Note:
This lab represents an **attempt**, not a complete solution. I documented and followed the steps as far as my system allowed.
